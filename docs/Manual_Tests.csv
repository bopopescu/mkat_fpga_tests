Signed, 2's complement numbers are employed. They accumulate 9-bits values (8 bit multiplier output), where the arrival rate depends on the channeliser configuration.
 
 Considering the 4096-channel configuration at L-band and 500ms accumulations, 1712e6/8192*0.5=104492 additions take place per accumulation. The bit growth would be log2(104492)=16.67 bits. Thus, even at full-scale DC input values, only 17 bits of growth takes place. 9+17 = 26 bits. It is thus impossible to overflow the 32-bit accumulators with 500ms accumulations on L-band.
 
 Considering the 32768-channel configuration at L-band and 500ms accumulations, the bit growth would be log2(1712e6/65536*0.5)=13.67 bits. Thus, no overflows are possible here, either.
