\chapter{Introduction and Scope}
\section{Version Information}
\subsection{Hardware identification}
Refer to the minutes of the Test Readiness Review (TRR) for a list of the hardware items and versions included in this release.
\subsection{Software/firmware release information}
Refer to the minutes of the Test Readiness Review (TRR) for a list of the software and firmware items and versions included in this release.
\section{Context}
This document categorises all tests according to verification events. For each verification event a test configuration is prescribed. This test configuration is used for the execution of the test procedures listed for that verification event. Each test procedure tests for compliance to a CBF verification requirement which is listed at the start of the test procedure. It is critical that the test engineer ensures that the test procedure does indeed verify this verification requirement. Test results and reports provided will be analysed to ensure compliance to this verification requirement.
\section{Purpose}
This document forms part of a set of Qualification Test Procedures (QTPs) for the CBF. The complete set of CBF QTPs document the test procedures required to verify that the CBF meets specification.
A qualification Test Readiness Review (TRR) will be held before the portion of formal qualification documented in this QTP starts.
The resultant Qualification Test Report (QTR), together with the QTRs from other CBF Verification Events, will be reviewed at the Critical Design Review (CDR) of the CBF.
