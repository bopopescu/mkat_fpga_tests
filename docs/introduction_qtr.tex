\chapter{Introduction and Scope}
\section{Identification}
This document describes the Qualification Test Report (QTR) for the Correlator-Beamformer Qualification Test Procedure for Array Release 1.3 as described in [1].\newline
All CBF functionality, for AR1, is tested in this release and includes L-band wideband coarse and wideband fine channelisation, a beamformer and four, eight and 16 antenna correlators.\newline
This release is provided for deployment of AR1 to site with full functionality.
This particular Qualification Test Report {\bf (DocNumber)} describes the results of all test procedures relating to an {\bf DocInfo \it{(instrument)}}.
\subsection{Hardware identification}
Refer to the minutes of the Test Readiness Review (TRR) for a list of the hardware items and versions included in this release.
\subsection{Software/firmware release information}
Refer to the minutes of the Test Readiness Review (TRR) for a list of the software and firmware items and versions included in this release.
\section{Context}
This document categorises all tests according to verification events. For each verification event a test configuration is prescribed. This test configuration is used for the execution of the test procedures listed for that verification event. Each test procedure tests for compliance to a CBF verification requirement which is listed at the start of the test procedure. It is critical that the test engineer ensures that the test procedure does indeed verify this verification requirement. Test results and reports provided will be analysed to ensure compliance to this verification requirement.
\section{Purpose}
This document forms part of a set of Qualification Test Reports (QTRs) for the CBF. The complete set of CBF QTRs documents the results of the qualification test procedures required to verify that the CBF meets specification.
This Qualification Test Report (QTR), together with the QTRs from other CBF Verification Events, will be reviewed at the Critical Design Review (CDR) of the CBF.
